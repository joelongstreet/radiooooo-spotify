# radiooooo-spotify

Creates spotify playlists based on decade and mood, songs found via [radiooooo](http://radiooooo.com/).

## Running
You'll need to create a .env file with the following properties in order to auth and use Spotify's API: SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET. You can create your own app [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).

The app is currently only available via a command line tool. After creating your .env file, open a terminal, `cd` to this directory and run `npm start`;
